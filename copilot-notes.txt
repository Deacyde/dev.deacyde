  DEACYDE / MICHAEL WILLIAMS
  COPILOT SESSION NOTES
  Last updated: 2026-02-25
=====================================

PURPOSE OF THIS FILE
---------------------
This file serves two purposes:
1. Instructions for the other machine before starting work
2. Context for Copilot to read at the start of each session

When starting a new Copilot session, paste or reference this file
so Copilot is up to speed on the project, repos, and any recent changes.

Update this file whenever something important changes:
  - new apps or features built
  - repo structure changes
  - deployment notes
  - anything the next session needs to know

!! MACHINE B — ONE-TIME SETUP (do this once after repo rename) !!
------------------------------------------------------------------
The dev site repo was renamed from deacyde-site to dev.deacyde.
Run this once on the other machine to update the remote:

  git remote set-url origin https://github.com/Deacyde/dev.deacyde.git
  git pull origin main


RULE #1 — BEFORE ANY WORK ON ANY MACHINE
-----------------------------------------
Always git pull before starting. Never assume the repo is current.

  deacyde.com repo:   git pull origin master
  dev.deacyde repo:   git pull origin main

RULE #2 — AFTER FINISHING ON ANY MACHINE
------------------------------------------
Commit and push everything before switching machines.
For dev.deacyde, push to BOTH branches:

  git checkout production && git merge main && git push origin production
  git checkout main && git push origin main


=====================================

  OTHER APPS (Non-SEO section)
=====================================

  apps/minecraft-build-studio/
    → React + TypeScript + Three.js + Vite app (built, committed as dist/)
    → Current version: v1.0.10

    → IMPORTANT: sql.js loaded via window.initSqlJs (CDN script tag in
      index.html). Do NOT import sql.js via npm in database.ts.
      CDN: cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/sql.js@1.14.0/dist/sql-wasm-browser.js
    → DB API: runSQL(sql) uses db.exec() for INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE
              execQuery(sql) uses db.prepare()+stmt.getAsObject() for SELECT
              schema init uses db.exec() (supports multi-statement)

  GODADDY NOTES

- PHP + SQLite works on GoDaddy shared hosting
- After deploying urlmap: set apps/urlmap/data/ permissions to 755

  IMPORTANT REMINDERS
=====================================

- deacyde.com uses ABSOLUTE URLs for assets (https://deacyde.com/css/style.css)
- deacyde-site uses RELATIVE paths — don't mix them when syncing index.html
- noter localStorage key: noter_db
- url-map localStorage key: urlmap_db
