# Prompt: Build a Keyword Intent & Journey Analyzer Web App

## Context

I want to build a web application hosted on **dev.deacyde.com** that lets a user enter a keyword or phrase and instantly returns:

1. **Search Intent Classification** — Informational, Navigational, Commercial Investigation, or Transactional
2. **Buyer Journey Stage** — Unaware, Problem Aware, Solution Aware, Product Aware, or Most Aware (using Eugene Schwartz's awareness stages)
3. **Keyword Cluster Suggestion** — A thematic cluster the keyword likely belongs to (e.g., "ERP implementation," "financial close automation," "data connectivity")

The app should be a single-page web application with a modern, clean UI.

---

## Functional Requirements

### Core Feature
- A single input field where the user types a keyword or phrase and hits Enter or clicks "Analyze"
- On submission, the app calls the **Anthropic Claude API** (`claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`) to classify the keyword
- Results are displayed in a card-based layout below the input

### Result Cards (display after analysis)
1. **Search Intent** — Show the intent type with a color-coded badge and a 1-2 sentence explanation of *why* it was classified that way
2. **Buyer Journey Stage** — Show the stage name, a visual indicator of where it falls on the journey spectrum (like a progress bar or stepper), and a brief rationale
3. **Keyword Cluster** — Show a suggested cluster name, 3-5 related keywords that would belong in the same cluster, and a brief description of the cluster theme
4. **Content Recommendation** — A bonus section suggesting what type of content would best serve this keyword (e.g., "comparison guide," "how-to tutorial," "product landing page," "case study")

### Additional Features
- **History sidebar or section** — Keep a running log of analyzed keywords during the session so the user can compare
- **Export** — Let the user copy results to clipboard or download the session history as CSV
- **Bulk mode** — Allow pasting a comma-separated list of keywords and analyze them all, returning a table view of results

## Technical Requirements

### Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript (vanilla or React — your choice, keep it simple and fast)
- **Backend**: Node.js or Python (lightweight API proxy to handle the Claude API call so the API key isn't exposed client-side)
- **API**: Anthropic Claude API via `/v1/messages` endpoint
- **Hosting**: This will be deployed on my dev server at dev.deacyde.com

### Claude API Prompt (use this as the system prompt for the API call)

```
You are an expert SEO strategist and keyword analyst. When given a keyword or phrase, analyze it and return a JSON response with the following structure:

{
  "keyword": "<the input keyword>",
  "search_intent": {
    "type": "Informational | Navigational | Commercial Investigation | Transactional",
    "confidence": "High | Medium | Low",
    "reasoning": "<1-2 sentence explanation>"
  },
  "buyer_journey": {
    "stage": "Unaware | Problem Aware | Solution Aware | Product Aware | Most Aware",
    "position": <number 1-5 corresponding to the stage>,
    "reasoning": "<1-2 sentence explanation>"
  },
  "keyword_cluster": {
    "cluster_name": "<descriptive cluster name>",
    "related_keywords": ["<keyword1>", "<keyword2>", "<keyword3>", "<keyword4>", "<keyword5>"],
    "theme_description": "<brief description of the cluster theme>"
  },
  "content_recommendation": {
    "format": "<e.g., How-to guide, Comparison page, Product page, Case study, Listicle>",
    "reasoning": "<why this format fits>",
    "suggested_title": "<a working title idea>"
  }
}

Classification rules:
- Informational: User wants to learn something (what, how, why, guide, tutorial, examples)
- Navigational: User is looking for a specific brand, product, or website
- Commercial Investigation: User is comparing options or researching before buying (best, vs, review, comparison, top)
- Transactional: User is ready to take action (buy, pricing, demo, free trial, download, sign up)

Buyer journey mapping:
- Unaware: Doesn't know they have a problem. Broad, curiosity-driven queries.
- Problem Aware: Knows the problem but not the solutions. Pain-point queries.
- Solution Aware: Knows solutions exist, exploring categories. "How to" and method queries.
- Product Aware: Knows specific products, comparing them. Brand + feature queries.
- Most Aware: Ready to buy, needs a final push. Pricing, demo, trial queries.

Always return ONLY valid JSON, no markdown formatting or code blocks.
```

## UI/Design Guidelines

- **Color scheme**: Dark mode preferred, with accent colors for each intent type:
  - Informational = Blue
  - Navigational = Purple  
  - Commercial Investigation = Amber/Orange
  - Transactional = Green
- **Typography**: Clean sans-serif (Inter, system-ui, or similar)
- **Layout**: Centered single-column, max-width ~800px, with the history panel as a collapsible sidebar or scrollable section below
- **Animations**: Subtle fade-in for results, loading spinner/skeleton while waiting for the API response
- **Responsive**: Should work well on both desktop and mobile

---

## Bulk Mode Specifications

When the user toggles to "Bulk Mode":
- Show a textarea instead of a single input
- Accept comma-separated or newline-separated keywords
- Display results in a sortable table with columns: Keyword | Intent | Journey Stage | Cluster | Content Type
- Allow CSV export of the full table

---

## Error Handling

- Show a friendly error message if the API call fails
- Handle rate limiting gracefully with a retry mechanism
- Validate input (reject empty submissions, trim whitespace)
- Set a reasonable timeout (30 seconds for single, 60 seconds for bulk)

---

## Getting Started

1. Set up the project directory structure
2. Build the backend API proxy first — confirm it can successfully call Claude and return results
3. Build the frontend UI with a hardcoded mock response to get the layout right
4. Wire them together
5. Add bulk mode and export features last

Please build this step by step, showing me each file as you create it, and let me test between major milestones.
